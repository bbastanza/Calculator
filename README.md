## Summary

I made this app continuing to further my knowledge of Javascript, HTML and CSS.

Building this app I had to figure out calculations using more challenging logic than I had used in previous applications. I had a lot of fun with this writing the applications functionallity and style.

While building this application I had to problem solve to make this calculator use continuous function, know when to edit which number and to use the memory buttons correctly.
